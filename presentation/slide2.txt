What is UnitTest?
(I REALLY hope you are not asking this...)

- Automatic tests for single units of code     

- Collection of assertions about the expected  
  behavior of a program                        

- Written by the developers for the developers 

- Strongly connected with the discipline of TDD

- F.I.R.S.T. (fast, independent, repeatable,   
  self-validating, timely-written)

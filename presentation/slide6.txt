QuickCheck: the good parts


Great tool to find bugs

Thinking about properties leads to a higher degree
of abstraction and may improve the architeture

Reduces the need of Data Providers for UnitTests

Generators for all primitive and common types are normally available
(some implementations can even infer which ones you need)

Achieves something similar to what DbC tries to do, but without
the runtime overhead and without polluting production code

Claims to make some (all?) UnitTests obsolete

What is QuickCheck?

- Testing technique invented to test Haskell code    
  using random input                                 

- Very similar to UnitTests in purpose and syntax,   
  but it tries to declare general properties that    
  should hold for any given input                    

- Brute force: will run the same assertion hundreds  
  of times with different inputs to try to find a    
  counter-example                                    

- Subset of UnitTests, but due to the abstract nature
  of its assertions is being called "Property Test"

QuickCheck: the bad parts


Slower than UnitTests (proportinal to the sampling size)

To write Generators can be tedious and error prone

Stable implementations only for some languages
(Haskell, Erlang, Scala, Clojure, Python)

Doesn't play well with stateful languages
(works better with functional languages)

Not compatible with TDD discipline
(tempts to write the tests after)

Tests are not deterministic!!!

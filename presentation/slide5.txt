Basic concepts:

- QuickCheck is not a library, but a testing strategy  

- Random input + large number of runs = better results 

- Random inputs are provided by "Generators" (monads)  

- "Arbitrary" and "Combinator" are classes/functions   
  that operates over Generators to compose more complex
  data types                                           

- Assertions are called "Properties" or "Hypothesis"   

- If a property test passes, it's said that it "holds",
  if not it is "falsified" by a "counter-example"      

- "Shrink" is the operation of reducing a large set of 
  counter-examples to its minimum (for easy debugging)
